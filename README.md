# huffmanCoded

This is a project I did while learning data structures. 

It encodes a string into a string of 0's and 1's. The code is made using a binary tree, and each leaf is a specific character. The location of the character on the tree depends on it's frequency. I then use the tree to decode the message to reveal the contents of the original text file.
